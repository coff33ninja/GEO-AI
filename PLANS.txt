### Enhancements:
1. **Dynamic Task Generation**:
   - While tasks are generated dynamically, you could add more variability or complexity, such as tasks with time constraints or multi-step objectives.

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
   - Introduce multiple agents that collaborate or compete in the same environment. This could involve shared goals or adversarial tasks.

3. **3D Geometric Worlds**:
   - While 3D support exists, you could expand it further by adding tasks like navigating 3D mazes or constructing 3D objects.

4. **Reinforcement Learning Visualization**:
   - Add heatmaps or trajectory visualizations to better understand the AI's decision-making process.

5. **Natural Language Interface**:
   - Allow users to set tasks or provide feedback using natural language commands.

6. **Leaderboard and Scoring System**:
   - Introduce a scoring system to compare the performance of different AI models or human players.

7. **Self-Play**:
   - Implement self-play for tasks like tessellation, where the AI competes against itself to improve strategies.

8. **Advanced Reward Shaping**:
   - Add intermediate rewards for partial progress, such as rewarding the AI for reaching closer to the target or forming valid angles.

9. **Multi-Agent Training**:
   - Train multiple agents simultaneously to encourage emergent behaviors and strategies.

10. **Task-Specific Policies**:
    - Train separate policies for each task and world, then combine them into a meta-policy for generalization.

11. **Dynamic Reward Scaling**:
    - Normalize rewards across tasks and worlds to ensure consistent learning.

12. **Enhanced Debugging Tools**:
    - Add step-by-step action replay or detailed logs of the AI's internal state for better debugging.

13. **Adaptive Difficulty**:
    - Dynamically adjust task difficulty based on the AI's performance to maintain a balanced challenge.

14. **Integration with External Tools**:
    - Connect the AI to external tools like CAD software for practical applications in design and engineering.

15. **AI Personality**:
    - Add personality traits to the AI, such as cautious, aggressive, or creative behavior, to make it more engaging.
