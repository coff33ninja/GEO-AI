Here are some features or enhancements you can add to the AI to improve its functionality or expand its capabilities:

1. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**:
   - Introduce multiple AI agents that collaborate or compete to complete tasks, enabling the study of multi-agent systems.

2. **Dynamic Task Generation**:
   - Add a system to dynamically generate new tasks or challenges for the AI, increasing the variety and complexity of the environment.

3. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Implement transfer learning to allow the AI to leverage knowledge from one task or world to perform better in another. - Done

4. **Explainable AI (XAI)**:
   - Add a module to explain the AI's decisions, such as why it chose a specific action or how it plans to complete a task. 

5. **Advanced Reward System**:
   - Introduce more sophisticated reward functions that consider factors like efficiency, creativity, or adherence to specific constraints.

6. **Real-Time User Interaction**:
   - Allow users to interact with the AI in real-time, such as guiding it, providing feedback, or setting custom goals.

7. **3D Geometric Worlds**:
   - Extend the game to support 3D geometric worlds, enabling tasks like drawing 3D shapes or navigating 3D spaces.

8. **Reinforcement Learning Visualization**:
   - Add visualizations to show the AI's learning process, such as heatmaps of visited states or action probabilities.

9. **Customizable AI Behavior**:
   - Provide options for users to customize the AI's behavior, such as adjusting exploration-exploitation balance or modifying learning rates.

10. **Integration with External Tools**:
    - Integrate the AI with external tools like CAD software, enabling practical applications in design and engineering.

11. **Enhanced Debugging Tools**:
    - Add advanced debugging tools, such as step-by-step action replay or detailed logs of the AI's internal state.

12. **Leaderboard and Scoring System**:
    - Introduce a scoring system and leaderboard to compare the performance of different AI models or human players.

13. **Natural Language Interface**:
    - Allow users to give commands or set tasks using natural language, making the system more accessible.

14. **AI Personality**:
    - Add personality traits to the AI, such as cautious, aggressive, or creative behavior, to make it more engaging.

15. **Adaptive Difficulty**:
    - Implement a system to adjust the difficulty of tasks based on the AI's performance, ensuring a balanced challenge.
