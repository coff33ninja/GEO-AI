To improve training further, here are some suggestions:

### 1. **Dynamic Reward Scaling**
   - Normalize rewards to ensure consistent scaling across tasks and worlds. This prevents large rewards in one task from dominating the learning process.

### 2. **Curriculum Learning**
   - Start with simpler tasks and gradually increase complexity. For example:
     - Begin with `TASK_LINE` in `WORLD_EUCLIDEAN`.
     - Progress to more complex tasks like `TASK_TRIANGLE` or `TASK_TESSELLATION` in `WORLD_HYPERBOLIC`.

### 3. **Augmented Replay Buffer**
   - Add a mechanism to prioritize transitions with high TD errors or rare experiences to improve learning efficiency.

### 4. **Adaptive Exploration**
   - Use a more sophisticated exploration strategy like **epsilon-greedy with noise** or **soft actor-critic** to balance exploration and exploitation.

### 5. **Reward Shaping**
   - Provide intermediate rewards for partial progress, such as:
     - Reward for reaching closer to the target in `TASK_LINE`.
     - Reward for forming valid angles in `TASK_TRIANGLE`.

### 6. **Transfer Learning**
   - Pre-train the model on simpler tasks or worlds and transfer the learned weights to more complex scenarios.

### 7. **Model Ensembles**
   - Use an ensemble of models to reduce overfitting and improve decision-making by averaging predictions.

### 8. **Visualization and Debugging**
   - Add more visualizations to monitor training progress, such as:
     - Heatmaps of action probabilities.
     - Graphs of TD errors over time.

### 9. **Regularization**
   - Add techniques like dropout or weight decay to prevent overfitting.

### 10. **Multi-Agent Training**
   - Introduce multiple agents to collaborate or compete, which can lead to emergent strategies and better generalization.

### 11. **Task-Specific Policies**
   - Train separate policies for each task and world, then combine them into a meta-policy for generalization.

### 12. **Data Augmentation**
   - Augment training data by simulating variations in tasks, such as:
     - Randomizing start and end points.
     - Adding noise to geometric shapes.

### 13. **Reward Clipping**
   - Clip rewards to a fixed range (e.g., `[-1, 1]`) to stabilize training and prevent large gradients.

### 14. **Learning Rate Scheduling**
   - Use a learning rate scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate based on performance or training progress.

### 15. **Self-Play**
   - Allow the AI to compete against itself in tasks like tessellation, which can lead to better strategies.
